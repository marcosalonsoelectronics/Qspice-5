Files for video Qspice-5: Closed-Loop Frequency Response of DC-DC Converters

Available at: https://youtu.be/GVhGpMAs0wQ

This video shows how to measure the closed-loop frequency response of a DC-DC converter using Qspice. Two procedures are shown: i) using the .bode statement, and ii) using the .fra statement.
Several Qspice simulations are presented to illustrate the methodology.
